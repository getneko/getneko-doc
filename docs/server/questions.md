# FAQ

1. Where is the storage location of the SQLite database file?  
   The database file is stored in the root directory with the filename `data.db`. You can use any SQLite-compatible database management tool to view it.

2. Version Naming Convention  
   If the version number starts with `beta`, it indicates a beta version. If it ends with `-rc+number`, it represents a release candidate version. Otherwise, it is a stable version.

3. What should I do if I find a translation error?    
   Currently, all translations are done by the GetNeko team, so errors may occur. If you find any mistakes, please submit an issue to us.
